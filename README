oolib Copyright 2014 by Walter de Jong <walter@heiho.net>

oolib is a library that aims to make developing in C++ easier by providing
some standard things like a String, an Array, a Dict (dictionary).
Although internally oolib uses STL and the C++ std library, you should be
able to do without and just use oolib.

The interface is based upon Python's and I borrowed some feats of Go (golang)
like go() and a channel type.


oolib is still very much beta software and not very well documented. If you
want to play around with it, check out the test codes.
